Write a function `greater_than_double(a: int, b: int) -> bool` that takes two integer inputs, `a` and `b`. The function should return `True` if one of the numbers is greater than double the other number. For example, if the inputs are `5` and `12`, the output should be `True` because `12` is greater than double `5`. If the inputs are `8` and `15`, the output should be `False` because neither `8` is greater than double `15` nor `15` is greater than double `8`.
