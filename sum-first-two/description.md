Given an array of integers, return the sum of the first two elements in the array. If the array length is less than 2, sum up the elements that exist, returning 0 if the array is empty. 

For example:
- If the array is `[1, 2, 3, 4]`, return `1 + 2 = 3`.
- If the array is `[5]`, return `5` (since there's only one element).
- If the array is `[]`, return `0`.
