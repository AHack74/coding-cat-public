Write a function `makes_ten(a: int, b: int) -> bool` that takes two integer inputs, `a` and `b`. The function should return `True` if either of the integers is `10`, or if their sum is `10`. For example, if the inputs are `7` and `3`, the output should be `True` because their sum is `10`. If the inputs are `10` and `5`, the output should be `True` because one of the integers is `10`. If neither condition is met, return `False`.
