Write a function `close_or_equal(a: int, b: int) -> bool` that takes two integer inputs, `a` and `b`. The function should return `True` if the two numbers are exactly equal or if their absolute difference is `1` or less. In other words, it should return `True` if `a == b`, `a == b + 1`, or `a == b - 1`; otherwise, it should return `False`. For example, if the inputs are `5` and `6`, the output should be `True` because the numbers are within one of each other.
