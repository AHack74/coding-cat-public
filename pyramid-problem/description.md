Write a function `pyramid_volume(L, W, H)` that determines the volume of a pyramid with a rectangular base:

- If the volume of the pyramid is greater than 40, return: "That's a big pyramid!"
- If the volume of the pyramid is between 25-39, return: "I mean, it's alright..."
- If the volume of the pyramid is below 25, return: "Baby pyramid"

- (L = 2, W = 3, H = 4) --> V = 8 --> The output would be "Baby pyramid"
- (L = 6, W = 6, H = 3) --> V = 36 --> The output would be "I mean, it's alright..."
- (L = 7, W = 8, H = 9) --> V = 168 --> The output would be "That's a big pyramid!"


(Rectangular base pyramid formula is (base x height)/3 or (length x width x height)/3)
