Write a function `in_order(a: int, b: int, c: int) -> bool` that takes three integer inputs, `a`, `b`, and `c`. The function should return `True` if the integers are in strictly increasing order (i.e., `a` < `b` < `c`). If the integers are not in increasing order, return `False`. For example, if the inputs are `1`, `2`, and `3`, the output should be `True` because `1` is less than `2`, and `2` is less than `3`. If the inputs are `3`, `2`, and `1`, the output should be `False` because the integers are not in increasing order.
