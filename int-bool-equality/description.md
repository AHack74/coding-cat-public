Write a function `int_bool_equality(n: int, b: bool) -> bool` that takes an integer `n` and a boolean `b` as inputs. The function should return `True` if the integer `n` is equal to `1` when `b` is `True` and equal to `0` when `b` is `False`. In other words, the function should return `True` if `n` equals `1` and `b` is `True`, or if `n` equals `0` and `b` is `False`. Otherwise, it should return `False`. For example, if the inputs are `1` and `True`, the output should be `True`.
