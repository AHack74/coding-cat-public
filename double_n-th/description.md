Write a function `double_n-th(str,n)` that when given a string and an integer "n", returns a new string where every "n"-th character in the original string is doubled based on the following conditions:

- If "n" is greater than the string length.
- If "n" is less than or equal to 0.
- If "n" is within the length of the string.

For example:
- If `(Programming,2)` is inputted, the output is `Prroggraammminng`.
- If `morning` is `false`, `mom` is `false`, and `is_asleep` is `true`, you should not answer because you are asleep, so the output is `false`.
- If `morning` is `true`, `mom` is `false`, and `is_asleep` is `false`, you should not answer because it is not your mom calling, so the output is `false`.
