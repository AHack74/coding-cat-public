Write a function `double_n-th(str,n)` that when given a string and an integer n, returns a new string where every n-th character in the original string is doubled based on the following conditions:

- Normally, you return the string with every n-th character doubled.
- If n is greater than the string length, return the original string.
- If n is less than or equal to 0, return "".


For example:
- If `(Programming,2)` is inputted, the output is `Prroggraammminng`.
- If `("hi",3)`, is inputted, the output is `hi`.
- If `("hi",-2)`, is inputted, the output is ` `.
