Write a function `triangle_area(base: float, height: float) -> float` that calculates the area of a triangle given its base and height. The area of a triangle can be calculated using the formula: area = 1/2 x base x height.

For example, if the base is `10.0` and the height is `5.0`, the output should be `25.0` because the area of the triangle is `0.5 * 10 * 5`.
