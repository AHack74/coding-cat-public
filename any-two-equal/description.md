Write a function `any_two_equal(a: int, b: int, c: int) -> bool` that takes three integer inputs: `a`, `b`, and `c`. The function should return `True` if any two of the three input numbers are the same, and `False` otherwise. For example, if the inputs are `3, 3, 4`, the output should be `True` because `a` and `b` are the same.
